# Unity Multiplayer RFCs

Many changes including bug fixes, documentation improvements and minor features can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design approval process and produce a consensus among the Unity Multiplayer team and the community.

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the Unity Multiplayer, so that both the Unity Multiplayer team and the community can be confident about the direction the project is evolving in.

The process is intended to be as lightweight as reasonable for the present circumstances. As usual, we are trying to let the process be driven by consensus and community norms, not impose more structure than necessary.
