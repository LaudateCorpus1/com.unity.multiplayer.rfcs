# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the Unity Multiplayer and you were teaching it to another Unity developer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how Unity developers should think about the feature, and how it should impact the way they develop multiplayer projects in Unity. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing Unity developers and new Unity developers.

For implementation-oriented RFCs (e.g. for framework internals), this section should focus on how Unity Multiplayer contributors should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy RFCs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms.
